        "In notebook 00, we built a simple research agent. In this notebook, we'll incrementally introduce key Claude Agent SDK features for building comprehensive agents. For each introduced feature, we'll explain:\n",
        "- **What**: what the feature is\n",
        "- **Why**: what the feature can do and why you would want to use it\n",
        "- **How**: a minimal implementation showing how to use it\n",
        "\n",
        "If you are familiar with Claude Code, you'll notice how the SDK brings feature parity and enables you to leverage all of Claude Code's capabilities in a programmatic headless manner.\n",

        "#### Scenario\n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout this notebook, we'll build an **AI Chief of Staff** for a 50-person startup that just raised $10M Series A. The CEO needs data-driven insights to balance aggressive growth with financial sustainability.\n",

        "**How**: Have your Python scripts set-up in a place where your agent can reach them and add some context on what they are and how they can be called. If the scripts are meant for your chief of staff agent, add this context to its CLAUDE.md file and if they are meant for one your subagents, add said context to their MD files (more details on this later). For this tutorial, we added five toy examples to `chief_of_staff_agent/scripts`:\n",
        "1. `hiring_impact.py`: Calculates how new engineering hires affect burn rate, runway, and cash position. Essential for the `financial-analyst` subagent to model hiring scenarios against the $500K monthly burn and 20-month runway.\n",
        "2. `talent_scorer.py`: Scores candidates on technical skills, experience, culture fit, and salary expectations using weighted criteria. Core tool for the `recruiter` subagent to rank engineering candidates against TechStart's $180-220K senior engineer benchmarks.\n",
        "3. `simple_calculation.py`: Performs quick financial calculations for runway, burn rate, and quarterly metrics. Utility script for chief of staff to get instant metrics without complex modeling.\n",
        "4. `financial_forecast.py`: Models ARR growth scenarios (base/optimistic/pessimistic) given the current 2.4M ARR growing at 15 percent MoM. Critical for `financial-analyst` to project Series B readiness and validate the $30M fundraising target.\n",
        "5. `decision_matrix.py`: Creates weighted decision matrices for strategic choices like the SmartDev acquisition or office expansion. Helps chief of staff systematically evaluate complex decisions with multiple stakeholders and criteria."

Namely, the agent will try calling its `ExitPlanMode()` tool once it is done planning, which is relevant in the interactive mode. In this case, you can send up a follow-up query with `continue_conversation=True` for the agent to execute its plan in context and changing the settings for `permission_mode`. Or, if you are building your own UX on top of the SDK, you can leverage the `ExitPlanMode()` toolcall itself, as it the agent will write its plan in the only parameter for this tool: `plan`. You can take this plan, render it for the user and, if the user accepts it, send a toolresult back to the agent saying something like \"The user has approved your plan, you can now get started\", but remember to change the `permission_mode` to toggle off plan mode."

        "\n",
        "**What**: Hooks are Python scripts that you can set to execute automatically, among other events, before (pre) or after (post) specific tool calls. Hooks run **deterministically**, making them perfect for validation and audit trails.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why**: Imagine scenarios where you want to make sure that your agent has some guardrails (e.g., prevent dangerous operations) or when you want to have an audit trail. Hooks are ideal in combination with agents to allow them enough freedom to achieve their task, while still making sure that the agents behave in a safe way.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How**:\n",
        "- Define hook scripts in `.claude/hooks/` -> _what_ is the behaviour that should be executed when a hook is triggered\n",
        "- Define hook configuration in `.claude/settings.local.json` -> _when_ should a hook be triggered\n",
        "- In this case, our hooks are configured to watch specific tool calls (WebSearch, Write, Edit, etc.)\n",
        "- When those tools are called, the hook script either runs first (pre tool use hook) or after (post tool use hook)\n",

For example, check the one for `.claude/agents/financial-analyst.md` and notice how a (sub)agent can be defined with such an easy and intuitive markdown file: frontmatter with three fields (name, description, and tools) and its system prompt. The description is useful for the main chief of staff agent to know when to invoke each subagent."

        "We've demonstrated how the Claude Agent SDK enables you to build sophisticated multi-agent systems with enterprise-grade features. Starting from basic script execution with the Bash tool, we progressively introduced advanced capabilities including persistent memory with CLAUDE.md, custom output styles for different audiences, strategic planning mode, slash commands for user convenience, compliance hooks for guardrailing, and subagent coordination for specialized tasks.By combining these features, we created an AI Chief of Staff capable of handling complex executive decision-making workflows. The system delegates financial analysis to specialized subagents, maintains audit trails through hooks, adapts communication styles for different stakeholders, and provides actionable insights backed by data-driven analysis.This foundation in advanced agentic patterns and multi-agent orchestration prepares you for building production-ready enterprise systems. In the next notebook, we'll explore how to connect our agents to external services through Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, dramatically expanding their capabilities beyond the built-in tools.Next: [02_The_observability_agent.ipynb](02_The_observability_agent.ipynb) - Learn how to extend your agents with custom integrations and external data sources through MCP."
